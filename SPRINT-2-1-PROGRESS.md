## 🛡️ **Business Logic Implemented**

### **Product Management Rules**
1. **SKU Uniqueness:** Each product must have a unique SKU
2. **Slug Uniqueness:** Each product must have a unique slug
3. **Category Validation:** Product must belong to an existing category
4. **Price Validation:** Price must be positive
5. **Stock Validation:** Quantity must be non-negative
6. **Deletion Protection:** Cannot delete products that have been ordered

### **Variant Management Rules**
1. **Variant SKU Uniqueness:** Each variant must have a unique SKU
2. **Product Association:** Variants must belong to an existing product
