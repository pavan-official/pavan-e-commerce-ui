# ðŸŽ¯ **Rollback Decision Process - Interview Questions**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Interview Questions**

### **Question 1: Rollback Decision Framework**

**Interviewer**: "How do you decide when to rollback vs when to fix forward?"

**Your Response**:
*"As a Platform Engineer, I use a structured decision framework based on severity, impact, and time to resolution. For critical issues like service downtime or security breaches, I rollback immediately (< 30 seconds). For high-impact issues like error rate spikes or performance degradation, I rollback quickly (< 1 minute). For medium issues, I consider the time to fix vs rollback - if fixing takes more than 5 minutes, I rollback. For low-severity issues, I investigate first and only rollback if the fix is complex or risky. The key principle is: when in doubt, rollback. It's always safer to rollback to a known good state and then fix the issue properly."*

**Key Points**:
- Structured decision framework based on severity
- Time-based decision criteria
- Risk assessment approach
- "When in doubt, rollback" principle

### **Question 2: Rollback Triggers and Monitoring**

**Interviewer**: "What triggers rollbacks in your system?"

**Your Response**:
*"I implement multiple rollback triggers at different levels. At the Kubernetes level, I use health check failures with failureThreshold: 3, which automatically rolls back if pods fail health checks. At the application level, I monitor error rates, response times, and business metrics through Prometheus alerts. If error rates exceed 2% or response times increase by more than 2 seconds, I trigger automatic rollbacks. I also have manual triggers for developers, DevOps engineers, and on-call personnel. The key is having both automatic and manual triggers with clear escalation procedures."*

**Key Points**:
- Multiple trigger levels (Kubernetes, application, business)
- Automatic and manual triggers
- Clear escalation procedures
- Monitoring integration

### **Question 3: Rollback Time Optimization**

**Interviewer**: "How do you minimize rollback time?"

**Your Response**:
*"I optimize rollback time through several strategies. First, I use rolling updates with maxUnavailable: 1 and maxSurge: 1 to ensure continuous availability during rollbacks. Second, I pre-pull images on nodes to reduce image pull time. Third, I use readiness and liveness probes with appropriate timeouts to quickly detect issues. Fourth, I implement blue-green deployments for critical services to enable instant traffic switching. Fifth, I have automated rollback scripts ready and tested. Finally, I use kubectl rollout undo with --watch flag to monitor progress in real-time. These strategies typically reduce rollback time from minutes to under 30 seconds."*

**Key Points**:
- Rolling update optimization
- Image pre-pulling
- Health probe configuration
- Blue-green deployments
- Automated scripts
- Real-time monitoring

### **Question 4: Rollback Communication**

**Interviewer**: "How do you handle communication during rollbacks?"

**Your Response**:
*"I have a structured communication plan for rollbacks. For immediate rollbacks, I send Slack notifications to the #incidents channel with severity level, affected services, and estimated resolution time. For stakeholders, I send email updates with business impact assessment and next steps. I update status pages for customer-facing issues. I document everything in incident management tools like PagerDuty or Jira. Post-rollback, I conduct a blameless post-mortem to analyze root causes and improve processes. The key is being transparent, timely, and focused on resolution rather than blame."*

**Key Points**:
- Structured communication plan
- Multi-channel notifications
- Stakeholder updates
- Status page management
- Incident documentation
- Post-mortem process

### **Question 5: Rollback Testing and Validation**

**Interviewer**: "How do you test rollback procedures?"

**Your Response**:
*"I test rollback procedures through multiple approaches. First, I run regular rollback drills in staging environments to validate procedures and timing. Second, I use chaos engineering tools like Chaos Monkey to simulate failures and test rollback responses. Third, I implement automated rollback tests in CI/CD pipelines that deploy problematic versions and verify rollback functionality. Fourth, I conduct tabletop exercises with the team to practice decision-making and communication. Fifth, I monitor rollback success rates and timing to identify improvement opportunities. The goal is to make rollbacks routine and well-practiced, not emergency procedures."*

**Key Points**:
- Regular rollback drills
- Chaos engineering testing
- Automated rollback tests
- Tabletop exercises
- Success rate monitoring
- Routine practice approach

## ðŸŽ¯ **Advanced Interview Questions**

### **Question 6: Multi-Environment Rollback Strategy**

**Interviewer**: "How do you handle rollbacks across multiple environments?"

**Your Response**:
*"I implement environment-specific rollback strategies. For development, I use immediate rollbacks with minimal validation since the impact is low. For staging, I use gradual rollbacks with comprehensive testing to validate the rollback process. For production, I use immediate rollbacks for critical issues but gradual rollbacks for performance issues to minimize user impact. I maintain separate rollback procedures for each environment with appropriate approval workflows. I also use environment-specific monitoring and alerting to ensure rollbacks are triggered appropriately for each environment's risk profile."*

**Key Points**:
- Environment-specific strategies
- Risk-based approach
- Separate procedures
- Approval workflows
- Environment-specific monitoring

---

### **Question 7: Rollback Metrics and KPIs**

**Interviewer**: "What metrics do you track for rollback performance?"

**Your Response**:
*"I track several key rollback metrics. First, Mean Time to Rollback (MTTR) - the time from issue detection to rollback completion. Second, rollback success rate - the percentage of rollbacks that successfully restore service. Third, rollback frequency - how often rollbacks occur, which indicates deployment quality. Fourth, business impact metrics - revenue loss, user complaints, SLA breaches during rollback events. Fifth, rollback duration - how long the rollback process takes. I use these metrics to optimize rollback procedures, identify deployment quality issues, and demonstrate the value of robust rollback capabilities to stakeholders."*

**Key Points**:
- MTTR tracking
- Success rate monitoring
- Frequency analysis
- Business impact measurement
- Duration optimization
- Stakeholder value demonstration

### **Question 8: Rollback Automation**

**Interviewer**: "How do you automate rollback decisions?"

**Your Response**:
*"I implement automated rollback decisions through multiple layers. At the infrastructure level, I use Kubernetes health checks and resource limits to trigger automatic rollbacks. At the application level, I use Prometheus alerts with specific thresholds for error rates, response times, and business metrics. At the CI/CD level, I implement automated rollback triggers based on test failures or deployment health checks. I use tools like Argo Rollouts for advanced rollback automation with canary deployments and automated analysis. The key is having multiple automated triggers with human oversight for complex decisions."*

**Key Points**:
- Multi-layer automation
- Infrastructure-level triggers
- Application-level monitoring
- CI/CD integration
- Advanced tooling
- Human oversight
