# ðŸŽ¯ **Learning Point**: Why do we use namespaces?
# 1. **Resource Isolation**: Each environment gets its own resources
# 2. **Security Boundaries**: RBAC can be scoped to namespaces
# 3. **Resource Quotas**: Limit resource usage per environment
# 4. **Network Policies**: Control traffic between environments
