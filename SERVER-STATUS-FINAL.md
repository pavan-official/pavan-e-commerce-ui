## 💻 **Technical Details:**

### **Server Configuration:**

// Next.js is automatically using port 3000
// (port 3001 was specified in config but 3000 was in use)
Server: Next.js 15.4.5 (Development Mode)
Port: 3000
URL: http://localhost:3000
Network: http://192.168.1.183:3000
Environment: .env.local, .env
```

### **Environment Variables:**
```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3001"  ← Update to 3000 if issues
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="ST3BArqqL/QIo4m5XZnHZNTcz2wQAF3Du8r78gVf7Hw="  ← ✅ Fixed
DATABASE_URL="..." ← Configured
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="..." ← Configured
```

## 🎯 **Issue Resolution Summary:**

### **What Was the Problem?**
You were trying to access `http://localhost:3001`, but the server is actually running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### **Why Did This Happen?**
- Port 3000 was already in use when the server started
- Next.js automatically selected the first available port (3000)
- The `.env.local` file specifies 3001, but the actual running port is 3000

### **The Solution:**
Simply use the correct URL: **http://localhost:3000**
