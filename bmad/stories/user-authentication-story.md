- **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling for auth operations

### Data Models
```typescript
// User Model
type User = {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // hashed
  name: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// Session Model (NextAuth.js)
type Session = {
  user: {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    name: string;
    role: string;
  };
  expires: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
```typescript
// Authentication API Routes
POST /api/auth/signin - User login
POST /api/auth/signup - User registration
POST /api/auth/signout - User logout
POST /api/auth/reset-password - Password reset request
POST /api/auth/update-password - Password update
GET /api/auth/session - Get current session
```

### Integration Requirements
- **Admin Dashboard:** Protect admin routes with role-based access
- **Client Storefront:** Optional authentication for enhanced features
- **Shopping Cart:** Persist cart for authenticated users
- **Order Management:** Link orders to authenticated users

## Implementation Details
### Technical Approach
1. **Setup NextAuth.js**
   - Install and configure NextAuth.js
   - Set up credentials provider
   - Configure JWT and session settings

2. **Database Integration**
   - Create User model with Prisma
   - Set up database connection
   - Create migration scripts

3. **Authentication Components**
   - Login form component
   - Registration form component
   - Password reset form component
   - User profile component

4. **Route Protection**
   - Create middleware for route protection
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Protect admin and user routes

### Component Design
```typescript
// Authentication Components
- LoginForm.tsx - User login form
- RegisterForm.tsx - User registration form
- PasswordResetForm.tsx - Password reset form
- UserProfile.tsx - User profile management
- AuthProvider.tsx - Authentication context provider
- ProtectedRoute.tsx - Route protection wrapper
```

### State Management
- **NextAuth.js Session:** Global session state
- **React Context:** Authentication context for components
- **Local State:** Form state management with React Hook Form

### Routing and Navigation
- **Protected Routes:** Admin dashboard routes
- **Public Routes:** Client storefront (with optional auth)
- **Auth Routes:** Login, register, password reset pages
- **Redirect Logic:** Redirect based on user role and authentication status

### Styling and UI
- **Design System:** Use existing Shadcn/ui components
- **Forms:** Consistent form styling and validation
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first responsive design
- **Accessibility:** ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load authentication components
- **Session Caching:** Efficient session caching
- **Bundle Size:** Minimize authentication bundle impact
- **Database Queries:** Optimize user queries

### Security Requirements
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt with salt rounds
- **JWT Security:** Secure JWT configuration
- **CSRF Protection:** CSRF token validation
- **Rate Limiting:** Login attempt rate limiting
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive input validation

## Testing Requirements

- **Test-Driven Development:** Write tests before implementation
- **Code Review:** Peer review for all authentication code
- **Security First:** Security considerations in every step

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript:** Strict typing for all authentication code
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Validation:** Input validation on both client and server
- **Documentation:** Clear documentation for authentication flow

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library
- **Integration Testing:** API route testing
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright for user flows
- **Security Testing:** Manual security review

### Deployment Considerations
- **Environment Variables:** Secure environment variable management
- **Database Migration:** Safe database migration process
- **Session Configuration:** Production session configuration
- **Security Headers:** Security headers configuration

## Risk Assessment
### Technical Risks
- **NextAuth.js Configuration:** Complex configuration requirements
- **Database Migration:** Risk of data loss during migration
- **Session Management:** Session persistence issues
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Authentication security risks

### Business Risks
- **User Experience:** Authentication flow complexity
- **Performance Impact:** Authentication performance impact
- **Integration Issues:** Integration with existing features
- **User Adoption:** User adoption of authentication features

### Dependencies
- **Database Setup:** Requires database configuration
- **Email Service:** Requires email service for password reset
- **Environment Configuration:** Requires production environment setup

## Notes and Context
### Additional Context
- This is the first major enhancement to the existing e-commerce platform
- Authentication is foundational for other features like order management
- Existing components need to be updated to work with authentication
- Admin dashboard already exists and needs to be protected

### Assumptions
- NextAuth.js is the preferred authentication solution
- PostgreSQL will be used as the database
- Existing UI components can be reused for authentication forms
- Role-based access control is sufficient for current needs

### Questions
- Should we implement social login (Google, GitHub) in this story?
- What email service should we use for password reset?
- Should we implement two-factor authentication?
- What are the specific admin role requirements?
