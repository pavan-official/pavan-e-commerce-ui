"Analyze requirements for adding user authentication to the e-commerce platform"
```

**Workflow:**
1. **Analyst Agent** - Gather authentication requirements
2. **Architect Agent** - Design auth system architecture
3. **Scrum Master** - Create detailed implementation stories
4. **Dev Agent** - Implement using story context
5. **QA Agent** - Test authentication features

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
Use BMAD for systematic performance improvements:

#### Example: Optimize Loading Performance
```
*architect
"Design performance optimization strategy for the e-commerce platform"
```

**Areas for Optimization:**
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Code splitting and bundle optimization
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies

### 3. **New Feature Development**
Use BMAD for planned feature additions:

#### Example: Add Product Reviews
```
*analyst
"Analyze requirements for adding product review system"
```

**Features to Consider:**
- User review submission
- Review display and rating
- Review moderation
- Review analytics

### 4. **Code Quality Improvements**
Use BMAD for systematic code improvements:

#### Example: Add Comprehensive Testing
```
*qa-agent
"Create testing strategy for the e-commerce platform"
```

**Testing Areas:**
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for APIs
- E2E tests for user journeys
- Performance testing

## BMAD Workflow for Existing Projects

### Phase 1: Enhancement Planning (Web UI)
1. **Identify Enhancement Areas**
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Missing features
   - User experience improvements
   - Security enhancements

2. **Use Analyst Agent**
   ```
   *analyst
   "Analyze the current e-commerce platform and identify enhancement opportunities"
   ```

3. **Use Architect Agent**
   ```
   *architect
   "Design architecture improvements for the e-commerce platform"
   ```

### Phase 2: Implementation (IDE)
1. **Scrum Master Creates Stories**
   - Detailed implementation stories
   - Complete context and requirements
   - Testing specifications

2. **Dev Agent Implements**
   - Uses story context for implementation
   - Follows architectural guidelines
   - Maintains code quality

3. **QA Agent Validates**
   - Tests new implementations
   - Ensures quality standards
   - Validates against requirements

## Specific Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. **User Authentication & Authorization**
**Current State:** No authentication system  
**Enhancement:** Add NextAuth.js integration

**BMAD Workflow:**
```
*analyst
"Analyze requirements for user authentication system"
```

**Implementation Areas:**
- User registration and login
- Protected routes
- Role-based access control
- Session management

### 2. **Database Integration**
**Current State:** Static data in components  
**Enhancement:** Add database integration

**BMAD Workflow:**
```
*architect
"Design database architecture for e-commerce platform"
```

**Implementation Areas:**
- Product database
- User database
- Order management
- Inventory tracking

### 3. **Payment Processing**
**Current State:** Payment forms without processing  
**Enhancement:** Integrate Stripe payment processing

**BMAD Workflow:**
```
*analyst
"Analyze requirements for payment processing integration"
```

**Implementation Areas:**
- Stripe integration
- Payment form validation
- Order processing
- Receipt generation

### 4. **Advanced Features**
**Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Product search with filters
- Wishlist functionality
- Product recommendations
- Order tracking
- Email notifications
- Admin analytics dashboard

## BMAD Agent Commands for Enhancements

### Planning Commands
```
*analyst - Analyze enhancement requirements
*pm - Plan enhancement sprints
*architect - Design enhancement architecture
#bmad-orchestrator - Get guidance on enhancement workflow
```

### Development Commands
- **Scrum Master** creates enhancement stories
- **Dev Agent** implements enhancements
- **QA Agent** tests enhancements

## Best Practices for Supplementary Usage

### 1. **Incremental Enhancements**
- Focus on one enhancement at a time
- Use BMAD for planning and implementation
- Maintain existing functionality
- Test thoroughly before deployment

### 2. **Documentation Updates**
- Update PLANNING.md with new architecture
- Update TASK.md with enhancement tasks
- Document new features and changes
- Maintain story documentation

### 3. **Quality Assurance**
- Use QA agent for testing
- Maintain code quality standards
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Monitor performance impact

### 4. **Stakeholder Communication**
- Use PM agent for stakeholder updates
- Document enhancement progress
- Gather feedback and requirements
- Plan enhancement releases

## Example Enhancement Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Enhancement
"Add user authentication to the e-commerce platform"

### Step 2: Use Analyst Agent
```
*analyst
"Analyze requirements for user authentication system including registration, login, and protected routes"
```

### Step 3: Use Architect Agent
```
*architect
"Design authentication architecture using NextAuth.js with database integration"
```

### Step 4: Use PM Agent
```
*pm
"Plan authentication implementation sprint with timeline and resources"
```

### Step 5: Development Phase
