GET    /api/orders                    - Get user's orders with filtering
POST   /api/orders                    - Create order from cart
GET    /api/orders/[id]              - Get order details
PUT    /api/orders/[id]              - Update order (user)
```

GET    /api/admin/orders/[id]        - Get order details (admin)
PUT    /api/admin/orders/[id]        - Update order (admin)
```

## 📊 **State Management Features**

### **Order Store (Zustand)**
```typescript
interface OrderState {
  orders: Order[]
  currentOrder: Order | null
  isLoading: boolean
  error: string | null
}

interface OrderActions {
  fetchOrders: (filters?: { status?: string; page?: number; limit?: number }) => Promise<void>
  fetchOrder: (orderId: string) => Promise<void>
  createOrder: (orderData: any) => Promise<Order | null>
  updateOrder: (orderId: string, updates: any) => Promise<void>
}
```

## 🛡️ **Business Logic Implemented**

### **Order Creation Rules**
1. **Cart Validation:** Must have items in cart to create order
2. **Stock Validation:** Check stock availability for all items
3. **Address Validation:** Require complete shipping and billing addresses
4. **Total Calculation:** Calculate subtotal, tax (8%), shipping, and total
5. **Order Number Generation:** Unique order numbers with timestamp and random string
6. **Inventory Update:** Decrease stock quantities after order creation
7. **Cart Clearing:** Remove items from cart after successful order

### **Order Management Rules**
1. **User Association:** Orders are tied to authenticated users
2. **Status Tracking:** Track order and payment status separately
3. **Admin Access:** Only admins can update order status and tracking
4. **Order History:** Users can view their order history with filtering
5. **Status Progression:** Order status follows logical progression
